            In a community that values diversity as much as Punahou, one group seems to be missing–people in wheelchairs. Although no restrictions prevent these people from accessing the academy campus, physical barriers make doing so difficult. Because of this, seeing visitors, let alone students, in wheelchairs is rare. To remedy this, Punahou has started to make an effort to improve wheelchair accessibility, but it has far to go before people in wheelchairs would be able to experience all that our campus has to offer.

            The Library is a central hub of campus, and with its new design as the Learning Commons it is meant to support the needs of everyone at Punahou. If this is its intended purpose, it should be available to members of the school community in wheelchairs as well. However, because of its design, this is currently not the case. The main entrance to the Learning Commons is only accessible by stairs.

            The Learning Commons’ back entrance can be reached in a wheelchair, but doing so requires passing over a three inch curb. Additionally, a sign on this doorway tells readers not to enter.

            The Price of Tradition

          <div class="block-center-paragraph">
            Pauahi Hall is one of the oldest buildings in the academy. It opened in 1896 and now stands, without renovations since the 90’s, as a testament to Punahou’s history. This emphasis on traditionality in the redesigns of the building, however, makes it entirely inaccessible for people in wheelchairs.

        <div class="block">

            Each of its four entrances are only accessible by stairways, and its doors are heavy and swing closed quickly. Additionally, despite being the only three-story academic building in the academy, Pauahi does not have an elevator. Accessing this building in a wheelchair alone would be impossible, and with help would still be very difficult.

            Cooke Hall, built in 1908 and last renovated in 1989, suffers from the same design limitations as Pauahi. Both its basement, which houses its classrooms, and its main floor, where many of the faculty’s offices are located, are only accessible by staircases. This poses not only an obstacle for students and visitors with limited mobility, but also faculty.

            Bingham Hall and Griffiths Hall, built in 1957-58, reflect a different understanding of the importance of accessibility than Pauahi and Cooke. These buildings’ open designs and ground-level entrances allow for easier maneuvering for people in wheelchairs. However, these buildings still don’t have elevators, so only their first floor classrooms are accessible.

            Mamiya Science Center, completed in 1999, is in part a product of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. It exemplifies accessibility in the academy, having multiple ramps in place of staircases and an elevator between its two floors. Its universal design is already serving as a model for other areas of campus, as recent renovations in the elementary, lower, and middle schools all make accommodations for people with limited mobility.

            Evidently, Punahou’s degree of accessibility is improving. Its newest buildings exhibit almost none of the barriers that limit access to Pauahi and Cooke. Its accommodations for students with temporary mobility limitations facilitate their injury recoveries. However, Punahou is still not fully equipped to take on students and faculty with wheelchairs or major mobility impairments. Unless another building was renovated to have an elevator, these groups would be able to access only ground-level floors in all academy buildings except Mamiya. Although it would be unprecedented and costly, redesigning these buildings to favor accessibility over traditionality would correct this. Additionally, a temporary curb cut should be installed at the back entrance to the Learning Commons to provide entry for members of these groups into the space too. Eventually, though, a ramp to the main entrance of the Learning Commons must exist so people with physical impairments can enter alongside those without. Finally, as a community our attitudes towards disability must change. As Punahou grows to include these people we must learn to treat them as we would any other members of the community.
